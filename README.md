# Simple Raytracer - Work in Progress

This is a small personal project aiming to practice basic C++ and computer graphics concepts, starting from scratch.

The current version is a work in progress and primarily focuses on basic structure and exploration.  
Comments, code quality, and features will be gradually improved over time.

**Disclaimer:**  
This repository is intended for personal growth and experimentation, not for showcasing production-ready code.
